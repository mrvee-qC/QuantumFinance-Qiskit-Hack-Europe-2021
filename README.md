## The Pitch
Formulated around achieving higher accuracy and speeds, our solution aims for an efficient and economical resource consumption as compared to classical counterparts with a scalable approach across all levels of problem domain (portfolio, organisation, financial system) featuring Multi QaaS compatibility - IBM Q, Honeywell (Azure), IonQ (AWS) with cross platform plugin integrations.

## The Proposal Overview
Leveraging the power of quantum computing to solve the hurdles of the financial domain which has an abundance of hard problems, this modular implementation aims to efficiently manage complex, strongly correlated & difficult to predict systems that traditional classical approaches struggle to evaluate. The inherent features of a quantum mechanical system make it an excellent platform to build upon.
